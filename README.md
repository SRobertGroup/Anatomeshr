## 1. About
Converter of 2D plant cell network into GEO file for finite element meshes

High-resolution plant anatomical data from multiple imaging sources are now widely available, yet leveraging these data for biomechanical modeling remains technically challenging. We present a user-friendly Shiny application that streamlines the process of converting 2D plant tissue images into finite element meshes compatible with mechanical simulation frameworks. The app supports heterogeneous inputs including CellSeT .xml, ImageJ .roi, and pre-defined anatomical templates. Output meshes include user-defined parameters for wall thickness and vertex smoothing. This tool integrates seamlessly with BVPy, a Fenics-based finite element framework, enabling cell inflation and stress tensor field visualization.
